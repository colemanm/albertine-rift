# Albertine Rift

A microsite to present [Albertine Rift](http://colemanm.org/albertine-rift), a map I created in [TileMill](http://mapbox.com/tilemill).

The site uses HTML, GitHub Pages, easey, and is hosted on MapBox.

I've also posted the messy, hacky [carto design files](), so you can see all the manual labeling and tweaking. A lot of the data was in PostGIS tables, some from shapefiles, and some custom generated GeoTIFFs from the raw SRTM DEMs. I also used the font [Alegreya](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Alegreya), which you can get for free.
